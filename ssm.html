        <div class="my-3">
        we are repeatedly warned not the unzip the entire file as it is very large. the code essentially copy and pastes a gif together, adding more and more loops until it becomes extremely massive (500gb). there is a single iteration where the gif is showing the flag instead, and we need to recover it. as an aside, the reason .zstd was used was because an incredibly efficient compression method was needed to be able to squeeze the file into a reasonable size to handout to players, and the regular, familiar compression methods were simply not cutting it.</div>

        <div class="my-3">we can start by decompressing the file in streams, and parsing each frame of the gif. streaming will help us parse the file using a reasonable amount of resources (we obviously cannot load the entire file into memory), and if we can parse the frames one by one we should be able to identify the frame of the gif that contains the flag by checking to see if it is different from all the rest.</div>

        <div class="my-3">my intent w writing the chall was to force the solver to write their own bespoke streamed gif parser, so that's what i did. i personally did not research to see if there is any library out there that already does this but i cannot possibly imagine there is, feel free to @ me if i am wrong. the forensics part of this challenge is to understand the file format of a .gif, and how its frames are stored as data. let's go over that now.</div>

        <div class="my-3"><a href="https://giflib.sourceforge.net/whatsinagif/bits_and_bytes.html">this resource</a> was very useful to me in the writing of this challenge. i'm going to grossly simplify it. simply put, there is a GIF header which contains metadata like image dimensions and color palette (these files use indexed color palettes, so the color palette is essentially stored as an array that is 'indexed into' by the image data).</div>

        <div class="my-3">from the code provided we can see that the first <span class=font-mono>0x320</span> bytes are the gif header, so good thing that's taken care of for us. we can then begin parsing the individual frames. so far note that we do not call <span class=font-mono>.read()</span> on the entire file, and instead selectively load in the specific number of bytes we want.</div>

        <pre><code class="language-python">

            all image descriptors start with the bytes <span class="font-mono">0x2c</span>. we might expect that the next byte after reading our header will therefore finally be image data, but nope - it starts with a <span class="font-mono">0x21</span>, which we learn is part of the graphics control extension, an 8-byte long string of metadata. we read and discard it.

            the code collects all the necessary gif data, and then computes the hashes. now a few things i handwaved over:
            the graphics control extension exists in every image block, so does the image description and the additional lzw compression byte. those are, for our purposes, basically auxiliary gif headers and therefore irrelevant to the block collection. when running this code we see that the first 50 frames or so are unique, and then they all repeat, and then somewhere around the 80000k mark we get completely new hashes - this is a good sign!

          <span class=font-mono>author's notes:</span> first of all, i fucking love wowaka. stream unhappy refrain. second of all, i'm always a fan of learning more about file formats, and the gif file format, as ancient and inefficient as it is, was really fun to dig into. i hope my solvers also thought it was fun. i think there's even more you can do w this challenge that involves parsing the .zstd itself and finding potential offsets the flag could be buried at, but i wanted to make it a bit simpler. i'm also surprised at how inefficient compression algorithms are with a file like this - even the .zstd itself is far larger than it should be, with a lot of repeated chunks if you pore into the actual hexdigest.

        <div class="my-3">astute solvers might realise that <span class=font-mono>triple-baka</span> is actually just Graham's number computed via hyperoperations. we're given an LCG and we need to compute the graham's number-th iteration of the LCG to recover our plaintext. obviously we can't compute G64 iterations of an LCG, so we need to find some closed form for the nth term of an LCG. you can either derive it yourself (frankly i'm too dumb to) or find a resource online that already has it derived for you, i found one on this <a href='https://www.nayuki.io/page/fast-skipping-in-a-linear-congruential-generator'> blog.</a></div>

        <div class="my-3">the closed form listed on that site requires us to calculate a to the power of n mod m, where a and m are LCG parameters and N is graham's number. how do we do this? recall that a ^ phi(m) is 1 mod m, and following from this a ^ (N mod (phi m)) is congruent to a ^ N mod m. here the problem reduces to solving for N mod phi m. m is small enough to factor so calculating phi(m) is trivial, but how do we then find graham's number mod phi(m)?</div>

        <div class="my-3">i'll just cut to the chase on the vuln here: my EC class implements it in Weierstrass form, but the curves used are Montgomery curves. the correct parameters on the wrong curve form results in significantly weaker curves whose orders can be factorised in around 10 minutes or so, and from there, you can just do standard pohlig-hellman. note that some of the factors in the curves are still too big to calculate discrete logarithms on, so we can only recover around 180~ bits of k in a feasible amount of time. but from there, we can just brute force values of k that would work. this writeup is not very detailed because i kind of dont feel like it. these ideas are explained better in <a href='https://washi1337.github.io/ctf-writeups/writeups/flare-on/2024/7/'>this writeup</a>, where a lot of the ideas are similar (i referenced it a lot while making this challenge). but my solve script is here:</div>

    <div class="my-3">there is some weird typecasting and rune shit immediately present upon inspection of the code. indeed, this challenge is about two things: some characters are multibyte characters that take up more than one byte of space due to their unicode values being greater than 256, and if you give Go an integer bigger than an <span class=font-mono>int16</span> it will just silently truncate the integer to its bottom 16 bits. i will now elaborate on the first thing.</div>

    <div class="my-3">the standard set of printable ascii characters <span class=font-mono>' !"#$%&\'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~'</span> are all represented by the integers 32 through 126, which are numbers that can fit in a byte. but due to our best friends over at the Unicode Consortium, an organisation i spend a lot of time trying to mentally explode w/ my mind, some characters take up more than one byte of space, such as say, <span class=font-mono>风和日丽的早上</span>. the character for 风 has a codepoint of 39118, a value which needs two bytes.</div>

    <pre><code>
>>> ord('风')
39118
>>> len('风')
1
>>> ord('风').bit_length()
16
    </code></pre>

    <div class="my-3">the issue with writing any programming language where we deign to do something as bold and arrogant as 'calculating the length of a string' invariably falls into the issue of parsing multibyte characters such as these. because very obviously, 风 is just one character, and so it makes sense to treat the string '风' as having length 1. but it occupies two bytes of space, and the very natural solution of just taking the number of bytes in the string predictably fails. back to the challenge. how does our beloved Go deal with multibyte chars?</div>

    <div class="my-3">Go introduces the <span class=font-mono>rune</span>, which is essentially just an <span class=font-mono>int32</span>. every character is converted to a rune, and we calculate how many runes there are in each string. note that Go actually only does this if you explicitly tell it to, such as in the following code snippet from our challenge source:</div>
    
    <pre><code class="language-go">
if len([]rune(content)) > 32767 {
	http.Error(w, "Too much data, needs to fit an int16...", http.StatusInternalServerError)
      return
}
    </code></pre>

    <div class="my-3">here we see that we're dealing with rune representations. when we don't deal with rune representations, Go simply just takes the number of bytes in the string, such as if you call <span class=font-mono>len(content)</span>. the key to this challenge is that Go will return different values for <span class=font-mono>len(content)</span> and <span class=font-mono>len([]rune(content))</span>, and our challenge checks if <span class=font-mono>len([]rune(content))</span> is less than 32767, but inserts <span class=font-mono>len(content)</span> into the database. our primitive here (of sorts) is that we can get these values to mismatch by inserting multibyte chars. why is this relevant?</div>

    <pre><code class="language-go">
func hhhhhhghghughguhContent(content string, length int16) string {
	contentRunes := []rune(content)
	for i := 0; i < int(length) && i < len(contentRunes); i++ {
		r := contentRunes[i]
		if r != 'u' && r != 'g' && r != 'h' && r != 'U' && r != 'G' && r != 'H' {
			contentRunes[i] = '.'
		}
	}
	return string(contentRunes)
}
    </code></pre>

    <div class="my-3">the sanitiser behaves weirdly in that it accepts an int16 <span class=font-mono>length</span> that is specified independently from the <span class=font-mono>content</span> string itself. we can look at where <span class=font-mono>length</span> actually comes from in the code.</div>

    <pre><code class="language-go">	
post.ID = postID
post.Title = postTitle
post.Length = int16(postLength)
post.Content = hhhhhhghghughguhContent(postContent, post.Length)
post.CreatedAt, _ = time.Parse(time.RFC3339, createdAtStr)
templates.ExecuteTemplate(w, "post.html", post)

</code></pre>

    <div class="my-3">very curiously we cast <span class="font-mono">postLength</span> (recall that that is <span class=font-mono>len(post.content)</span>) as an <span class=font-mono>int16</span>.</div>
